## Router Rules (backend/app/routers)

- Define `APIRouter` with clear prefixes, PRD-aligned tags, and useful `responses`.
- Use `response_model` for every route; schemas live in app/schemas.
- Inject DB/auth/settings via dependencies; delegate to services for business logic.
- Add pagination/filtering/limits on list endpoints.
- Document callbacks/webhooks as OpenAPI callbacks (document, donâ€™t execute).
