## Service Rules (backend/app/services)

- Encapsulate business logic; own transaction boundaries; no HTTP concerns.
- Interact with ORM via sessions from app/core/database.py.
- Interact with agent via explicit interfaces; no router imports or HTTP concerns.
- Enforce PRD-driven behavior and error semantics; convert to domain errors for routers to map.
