"""
Delete Bot Use Case

Handles bot deletion with business rule validation and cascade operations.
Implements safe deletion with proper cleanup of related data.

Business Flow:
1. Validate input data via DTO
2. Retrieve existing bot from repository
3. Check authorization (user can only delete own bots)
4. Validate bot can be safely deleted (business rules)
5. Handle related data cleanup (conversations, training data)
6. Delete bot from repository
7. Log bot deletion event
8. Return deletion confirmation

Business Rules Enforced:
- Users can only delete their own bots
- Active conversations may prevent immediate deletion
- Training data should be preserved per retention policy
- Public bots with active users require grace period
- Deletion is irreversible (hard delete)

Cascade Operations:
- Mark related conversations as archived
- Preserve training data per retention policy
- Clean up temporary files and caches
- Notify users of public bot deletion
- Update analytics and usage metrics

Security Considerations:
- Authorization checks for bot ownership
- Audit logging for deletion events
- Data retention policy compliance
- Secure cleanup of sensitive data

Error Scenarios:
- Bot not found -> BotNotFoundException
- Unauthorized access -> AuthorizationException
- Active conversations -> BusinessRuleViolationException
- System bot deletion -> ValidationException
