"""
Infrastructure Layer - External Concerns Implementation

This is the outermost layer containing implementations of interfaces defined 
in inner layers. It handles all external dependencies and infrastructure concerns.

Contains:
- Repository Implementations: Database access using ORMs
- External Service Adapters: Third-party API integrations
- Database Configuration: Connection setup and migrations
- Messaging: Message queue implementations
- Caching: Cache provider implementations  
- AI Services: LLM and vector database integrations
- Configuration: Environment and settings management

Key Principles:
- Implements interfaces from domain and application layers
- Contains all framework-specific code
- Handles external dependencies (databases, APIs, etc.)
- Maps between domain entities and external representations
- Provides concrete implementations for dependency injection
- Manages infrastructure cross-cutting concerns

Technology Implementations:

Database:
- SQLAlchemy async ORM for PostgreSQL
- Alembic for database migrations
- Connection pooling and optimization
- Query optimization and indexing

External Services:
- Google Gemini API for LLM generation
- Pinecone for vector storage and retrieval
- Redis for caching and session storage
- SMTP for email notifications
- External webhook integrations

AI Infrastructure:
- Direct API clients (no frameworks)
- Vector embedding generation
- Context retrieval and ranking
- Response streaming implementations
- Performance monitoring and caching

Patterns:
- Adapter pattern for external services
- Repository pattern for data access
- Factory pattern for service creation
- Decorator pattern for cross-cutting concerns
