## Architecture

The ChatSphere platform is built with a microservices architecture, consisting of:

- [System Overview](./architecture/README.md): High-level architecture and component interactions
- [Frontend Architecture](./architecture/frontend.md): Vue.js frontend design and implementation
- [Backend Architecture](./architecture/backend.md): Django backend design and implementation
- [Database Schema](./architecture/database.md): Database design and relationships
- [AI Integration](./architecture/ai_integration.md): Integration with AI services

## Coding Standards

To maintain code quality and consistency, we follow these standards:

- [General Coding Standards](./standards/README.md): Overall coding principles and practices
- [Backend Coding Standards](./standards/backend.md): Python and Django specific guidelines
- [Frontend Coding Standards](./standards/frontend.md): JavaScript and Vue.js specific guidelines
- [API Design Standards](./standards/api.md): RESTful API design principles

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Docker and Docker Compose
   - Git
   - Node.js (for frontend development)
   - Python (for backend development)

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatsphere.git
   cd chatsphere
   ```

3. **Environment setup**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update with your settings
   - Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env` if needed

4. **Start the development environment**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

5. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api
   - Admin interface: http://localhost:8000/admin

## Development Workflow

Our development process follows these steps:

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```

3. **Push changes and create a pull request**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Code review**: At least one reviewer must approve the changes

5. **CI/CD**: Automated tests and builds via GitHub Actions

6. **Merge**: Changes are merged into the main branch

## Deployment

Deployment is handled through our CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Automated testing**: All tests must pass
2. **Docker image building**: Images are built and tagged
3. **Docker image publishing**: Images are pushed to Docker Hub
4. **Deployment**: For tagged releases, deployment occurs automatically

For more information on deployment, see the [deployment documentation](./deployment/README.md).
