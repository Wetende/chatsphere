# AI-Assisted Project Planning and Design

## Step 1: Define Project Requirements
- Use `@ai-requirements` to gather and document project needs.
- Generate a requirements spec in `requirements.md` using Cursor AI, covering functional and non-functional aspects.
- Validate with stakeholders, letting AI suggest clarifications or gaps.

## Step 2: Design Architecture
- Leverage Cursor AI to draft an initial architecture based on requirements.
- Document diagrams (e.g., component, data flow) in `architecture.md`.
- Iterate with AI feedback on scalability, security, and performance.

## Step 3: Plan Development Phases
- Divide the project into phases or sprints, defining tasks and milestones.
- Use Cursor AI to estimate durations and flag risks.
- Save the plan in `project-plan.md` for team review.

## Step 4: Validate the Plan
- Simulate execution using `@ai-tests`.
- Identify bottlenecks or constraints with AI analysis.
- Refine the plan based on feedback until optimized.

## Step 5: Document and Share
- Summarize the process in `planning.md`, noting lessons learned.
- Format documentation with Cursor AI for clarity and stakeholder approval.
