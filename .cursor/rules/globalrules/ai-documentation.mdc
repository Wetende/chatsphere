# AI-Assisted Documentation Generation and Maintenance

## Step 1: Define Documentation Scope
- Use `@ai-docs-scope` to outline required documentation (e.g., API docs, user guides).
- Draft a spec in `docs-plan.md` with sections, formats, and audiences.
- Enhance the spec with Cursor AI suggestions.

## Step 2: Generate Documentation
- Draft initial content with Cursor AI based on the spec.
- Generate code comments and API references for technical docs.
- Create user guides with step-by-step instructions and examples.

## Step 3: Review and Refine
- Manually check AI-generated content for accuracy.
- Use Cursor AI to ensure consistent tone and style.
- Revise until it meets quality standards.

## Step 4: Test Documentation Usability
- Validate clarity using `@ai-tests`.
- Simulate user scenarios to confirm helpfulness.
- Refine based on AI feedback.

## Step 5: Publish and Maintain
- Publish in an accessible format (e.g., Markdown, HTML).
- Automate updates with Cursor AI for ongoing maintenance.
