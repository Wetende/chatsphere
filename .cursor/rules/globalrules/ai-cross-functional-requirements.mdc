# Step 1: Define Cross-Functional Requirements
- Create a `cross-functional.md` document outlining accessibility, i18n, and responsiveness standards.
- Define compliance requirements (WCAG, GDPR, etc.).
- Use Cursor AI to analyze the existing codebase for compliance gaps.

# Step 2: Configure Cross-Functional Tools
- Set up tools for accessibility testing, i18n management, and responsive design verification.
- Configure automated checks for compliance requirements.
- Use Cursor AI to generate configuration for cross-functional tooling.

# Step 3: Implement Cross-Functional Features
- Apply accessibility patterns (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, etc.).
- Implement internationalization and localization support.
- Use Cursor AI to identify areas needing cross-functional improvements.

# Step 4: Test Cross-Functional Compliance
- Follow the instructions in `@ai-tests` to validate cross-functional requirements.
- Generate tests with Cursor AI that validate:
  - Accessibility compliance across devices.
  - Internationalization works properly with different locales.
  - Responsive design functions on various screen sizes.

# Step 5: Monitor and Improve
- Regularly audit for cross-functional compliance.
- Use Cursor AI to suggest improvements in accessibility and other cross-functional areas.
- Update `cross-functional.md` with new requirements and best practices.
