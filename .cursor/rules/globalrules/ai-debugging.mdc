# AI-Assisted Debugging and Error Detection

## Step 1: Identify the Bug
- Analyze error logs or reports using `@ai-bug-detection`.
- Scan the codebase with Cursor AI for issues (e.g., null pointers, race conditions).
- Log the bug in `bugs.md` with reproduction steps and impact.

## Step 2: Generate Fix Suggestions
- Use Cursor AI to suggest fixes based on context.
- For Go: Address goroutine leaks or memory issues.
- For JS/TS: Fix async errors or DOM issues.

## Step 3: Apply and Test Fixes
- Implement the fix and validate with `@ai-tests`.
- Generate tests with Cursor AI to cover the bug.
- Iterate until resolved.

## Step 4: Document the Fix
- Update `bugs.md` with resolution details and insights.
- Add code comments or docs with Cursor AI.
- Share with the team to avoid recurrence.

## Step 5: Monitor for Regressions
- Add monitoring for the fixed issue.
- Use Cursor AI to check future changes for regressions.
