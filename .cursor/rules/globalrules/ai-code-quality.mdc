# Step 1: Define Code Quality Standards
- Create a `code-quality.md` document outlining style guides, linting rules, and best practices.
- Define acceptable metrics (test coverage, complexity, etc.).
- Use Cursor AI to analyze existing codebase and suggest appropriate standards.

# Step 2: Configure Quality Tools
- Set up linters, formatters, and static analysis tools.
- Configure test coverage reporting with minimum thresholds.
- Use Cursor AI to generate appropriate configuration files.

# Step 3: Implement Quality Checks
- Integrate code quality checks into the development workflow.
- Set up pre-commit hooks for formatting and linting.
- Use Cursor AI to identify code that violates quality standards.

# Step 4: Test Quality Standards
- Follow the instructions in `@ai-tests` to write tests that enforce quality.
- Generate tests with Cursor AI that validate:
  - Code complexity metrics remain under thresholds.
  - Naming conventions are followed consistently.
  - Documentation is complete and accurate.

# Step 5: Monitor and Improve
- Regularly review code quality metrics and trends.
- Use Cursor AI to suggest refactoring opportunities.
- Update `code-quality.md` as standards evolve.
