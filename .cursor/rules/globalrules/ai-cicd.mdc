# AI-Assisted CI/CD Setup and Management

## Step 1: Design CI/CD Pipeline
- Use `@ai-cicd-design` to define stages (e.g., build, test, deploy).
- Draft a spec in `cicd.md` with tools and needs.
- Optimize with Cursor AI.

## Step 2: Generate Pipeline Scripts
- Create configs with Cursor AI (e.g., GitHub Actions).
- Include linting, testing, and deployment steps.
- Support multiple environments.

## Step 3: Integrate with Codebase
- Add configs to the repo.
- Check syntax with Cursor AI.
- Set up triggers for automation.

## Step 4: Test the Pipeline
- Validate with `@ai-tests`.
- Generate test cases for success and failure.
- Refine until reliable.

## Step 5: Monitor and Optimize
- Analyze performance with Cursor AI.
- Document setup in `cicd.md` with troubleshooting tips.
