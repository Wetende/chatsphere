# Step 1: Identify Refactoring Needs
- Create a `refactoring.md` document outlining code quality metrics and refactoring triggers.
- Define criteria for when to refactor (complexity thresholds, duplication rates, etc.).
- Use Cursor AI to analyze the codebase and identify refactoring candidates.

# Step 2: Plan Refactoring Approach
- Document the current behavior with tests before starting refactoring.
- Define the refactoring scope and strategy.
- Use Cursor AI to propose safe refactoring patterns for the identified issues.

# Step 3: Implement Refactorings
- Apply refactorings in small, verifiable steps.
- Maintain test coverage throughout the refactoring process.
- Use Cursor AI to assist with code transformations.

# Step 4: Test Refactored Code
- Follow the instructions in `@ai-tests` to validate refactored code.
- Generate tests with Cursor AI that validate:
  - Behavior remains unchanged after refactoring.
  - Code quality metrics have improved.
  - Performance has not regressed.

# Step 5: Document and Review
- Document the refactoring decisions and outcomes.
- Use Cursor AI to analyze the effectiveness of the refactoring.
- Update `refactoring.md` with new patterns and lessons learned.
