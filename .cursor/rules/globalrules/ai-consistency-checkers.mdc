# Step 1: Define Consistency Standards
- Create a `consistency.md` document outlining naming conventions, patterns, and architectural principles.
- Define metrics for measuring code consistency.
- Use Cursor AI to analyze existing codebase for consistency issues.

# Step 2: Configure Consistency Tools
- Set up linters and static analyzers with custom rules for consistency validation.
- Configure automated architecture conformance checks.
- Use Cursor AI to generate custom rules for static analysis tools.

# Step 3: Implement Consistency Checks
- Create custom validators for project-specific consistency rules.
- Implement data flow consistency checkers.
- Use Cursor AI to identify inconsistencies in code patterns.

# Step 4: Test Consistency Validation
- Follow the instructions in `@ai-tests` to validate consistency checks.
- Generate tests with Cursor AI that validate:
  - Naming conventions are enforced consistently.
  - Architectural boundaries are maintained.
  - Similar functionality uses consistent approaches.

# Step 5: Monitor and Enforce
- Regularly audit the codebase for consistency.
- Use Cursor AI to suggest consistency improvements.
- Update `consistency.md` with refined rules and best practices.
