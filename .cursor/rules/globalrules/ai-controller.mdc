# Step 1
Follow the instructions in `@ai-endpoints` to define the API endpoints for your controllers.
- Write a spec in `endpoints.md` with details like HTTP methods, paths, and request/response formats.
- Use Cursor AI to validate the spec and suggest improvements.

# Step 2
Generate the controller logic using Cursor AI.
- Reference the spec in `endpoints.md` to ensure consistency.
- Use `@codebase` to align the generated code with your project's framework (e.g., Express, Gin).

# Step 3
Integrate the generated controllers into your project.
- Hook the controllers into the framework's routing system.
- Add middleware for error handling and validation as needed.

# Step 4
Follow the instructions in `@ai-tests` to write tests for the controllers.
- Generate unit and integration tests with Cursor AI.
- Run the tests and iterate until all endpoints function correctly.
