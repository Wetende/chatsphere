# Step 1: Define Implementation Strategy
- Create a `progressive-implementation.md` document outlining MVP requirements and enhancement paths.
- Define feature flag strategy and gradual rollout approach.
- Use Cursor AI to analyze existing codebase for implementation patterns.

# Step 2: Configure Progressive Tools
- Set up feature flagging infrastructure.
- Configure A/B testing frameworks if applicable.
- Use Cursor AI to generate appropriate configuration files.

# Step 3: Implement Progressive Features
- Design features to support incremental deployment.
- Create feature flags for new functionality.
- Use Cursor AI to identify opportunities for progressive enhancement.

# Step 4: Test Progressive Implementations
- Follow the instructions in `@ai-tests` to validate progressive implementation.
- Generate tests with Cursor AI that validate:
  - Feature flags correctly control feature visibility.
  - System degrades gracefully when features are disabled.
  - A/B test variants function correctly.

# Step 5: Monitor and Evolve
- Track metrics for each progressive implementation phase.
- Use Cursor AI to suggest optimization opportunities.
- Update `progressive-implementation.md` with lessons learned.
