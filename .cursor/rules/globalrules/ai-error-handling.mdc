# Step 1: Design Error Handling Strategy
- Create an `error-handling.md` document outlining error types, severity levels, and handling patterns.
- Define standards for error messages, codes, and logging.
- Use Cursor AI to analyze existing error handling and suggest improvements.

# Step 2: Implement Error Handling
- Create consistent error types and hierarchies.
- Implement standardized error logging with appropriate context.
- Use Cursor AI to generate boilerplate error handling code.

# Step 3: Apply Error Handling Patterns
- Apply consistent error handling across the codebase.
- Implement recovery mechanisms and graceful degradation.
- Use Cursor AI to identify areas with insufficient error handling.

# Step 4: Test Error Scenarios
- Follow the instructions in `@ai-tests` to validate error handling.
- Generate tests with Cursor AI that validate:
  - Each error type is properly thrown and caught.
  - Error recovery mechanisms work as expected.
  - User-facing error messages are appropriate.

# Step 5: Monitor and Refine
- Analyze error patterns in production.
- Use Cursor AI to suggest improvements based on error frequencies.
- Update `error-handling.md` with new patterns and lessons learned.
