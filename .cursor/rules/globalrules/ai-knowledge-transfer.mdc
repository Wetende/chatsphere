# Step 1: Establish Knowledge Transfer Framework
- Create a `knowledge-transfer.md` document outlining documentation requirements and transfer processes.
- Define standards for documenting architectural decisions and rationales.
- Use Cursor AI to analyze existing documentation and identify knowledge gaps.

# Step 2: Implement Knowledge Capture
- Create an architectural decision record (ADR) system.
- Develop a project glossary for consistent terminology.
- Use Cursor AI to extract implicit knowledge from the codebase.

# Step 3: Apply Knowledge Management
- Document "why" decisions alongside "what" and "how" in code comments.
- Create comprehensive handover documentation for key components.
- Use Cursor AI to generate documentation templates and starter content.

# Step 4: Test Knowledge Accessibility
- Follow the instructions in `@ai-tests` to validate knowledge transfer effectiveness.
- Generate tests with Cursor AI that validate:
  - Documentation is understandable to new team members.
  - Critical decisions are properly recorded.
  - Key concepts are consistently explained.

# Step 5: Review and Refine
- Regularly review and update knowledge transfer documents.
- Use Cursor AI to suggest improvements to knowledge documentation.
- Update `knowledge-transfer.md` with new insights and approaches.
