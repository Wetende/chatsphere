# Sub-PRD: Document Processing Pipeline

## Overview
This Sub-PRD outlines the document processing system for ChatSphere, handling file uploads, text extraction, chunking, and embedding generation for bot training.

## User Stories
- **As a user**, I want to upload text files to train my bot so that it can answer questions about my content
- **As a user**, I want to upload PDF documents so that my bot can learn from formatted documents
- **As a user**, I want to see processing progress so that I know when my bot is ready
- **As a user**, I want to manage my uploaded documents so that I can add or remove training data
- **As a user**, I want error messages when uploads fail so that I can fix issues
- **As a user**, I want to process large documents efficiently so that I don't wait too long
- **As a user**, I want my documents to be chunked intelligently so that my bot gives better answers

## Functional Requirements
- Implement **file upload** with validation and size limits
- Create **text extraction** from multiple file formats
- Build **intelligent chunking** algorithms for optimal embedding
- Develop **background processing** for heavy operations
- Establish **progress tracking** with real-time updates
- Create **document management** with metadata storage

## Acceptance Criteria
- Supports TXT, PDF, DOCX file uploads up to 10MB
- Text extraction preserves formatting and structure
- Chunking creates segments of 500-1000 characters with overlap
- Background processing doesn't block API responses
- Real-time status updates via WebSocket or polling
- Document metadata stored with processing status
- Failed processing shows clear error messages
- Embeddings generated and stored in Pinecone with metadata

## Technical Specifications
- **File Processing**: PyPDF2, python-docx for text extraction
- **Chunking**: Custom algorithms with semantic boundary detection
- **Background Tasks**: FastAPI BackgroundTasks and Celery for heavy processing
- **Storage**: Document metadata in PostgreSQL, embeddings in Pinecone
- **Progress**: WebSocket updates or status endpoint for polling
- **Validation**: File type, size, and content validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and user feedback

## AI Coding Prompt
Implement document processing service with async file handling and background processing. Create intelligent chunking algorithms that preserve semantic meaning. Use FastAPI BackgroundTasks for processing coordination and WebSocket for real-time updates. Routes in `app/routers/documents_router.py` with endpoints `/api/v1/bots/{bot_id}/documents` for upload and management. Ensure proper error handling and status tracking.
