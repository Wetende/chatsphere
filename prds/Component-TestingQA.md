# Sub-PRD: Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance

## Overview
This Sub-PRD outlines the comprehensive testing strategy and quality assurance framework for ChatSphere, covering unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and automated quality checks.

## User Stories
- **As a developer**, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can refactor code confidently
- **As a QA engineer**, I want automated testing so that regressions are caught early
- **As a developer**, I want fast test execution so that I get quick feedback during development
- **As a user**, I want bug-free software so that my experience is smooth and reliable
- **As a team lead**, I want quality metrics so that I can track code quality over time
- **As a developer**, I want integration tests so that API contracts are verified
- **As a user**, I want end-to-end testing so that user workflows are validated
- **As a developer**, I want performance testing so that the system scales properly

## Functional Requirements
- Create **unit testing framework** for all backend and frontend components
- Build **integration testing** for API endpoints and database operations
- Implement **end-to-end testing** for complete user workflows
- Set up **performance testing** for load and stress testing
- Create **automated quality checks** with linting and code analysis
- Build **test data management** with fixtures and factories
- Implement **continuous testing** in CI/CD pipeline
- Create **test reporting** and coverage metrics

## Acceptance Criteria
- Unit test coverage above 90% for critical components
- All API endpoints have integration tests with async testing
- End-to-end tests cover major user workflows
- Performance tests validate sub-200ms response times
- Automated linting and type checking in CI/CD
- Test data factories provide realistic test scenarios
- Tests run automatically on every commit and PR
- Test reports generated with coverage and quality metrics
- Frontend components tested with React Testing Library
- Database tests use isolated test environments

## Technical Specifications
- **Backend Testing**: pytest with pytest-asyncio for async testing
- **Frontend Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E
- **API Testing**: httpx.AsyncClient for FastAPI testing
- **Database Testing**: SQLAlchemy test sessions with transaction rollback
- **Performance Testing**: locust or artillery for load testing
- **Code Quality**: black, isort, mypy, flake8 for Python; ESLint for TypeScript
- **Test Data**: factory_boy for Python fixtures, faker for realistic data
- **Mocking**: pytest-mock for backend, MSW for frontend API mocking
- **CI Integration**: GitHub Actions with test parallelization

## AI Coding Prompt
Create comprehensive testing framework using pytest for backend with async support and React Testing Library for frontend. Set up API integration tests using httpx.AsyncClient with FastAPI test client. Implement E2E tests with Playwright covering user workflows. Create test data factories with factory_boy and faker. Set up performance testing with locust. Configure code quality tools (black, mypy, ESLint) in CI/CD. Build test reporting with coverage metrics and quality gates.
