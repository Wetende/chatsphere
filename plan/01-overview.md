```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│  Frontend   │ ◄─►│   Backend   │
│  (React.js) │    │  (FastAPI)  │
└─────────────┘    └──────┬──────┘
       ▲                  │
       │                  │ Pinecone API
       │                  ▼
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│  User Data  │    │  Vector DB  │
│ (TBD)       │    │ (Pinecone)  │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```
