# ChatSphere Project Phases

This document outlines the implementation timeline, key milestones, and delivery schedule for the ChatSphere platform.

## Development Approach

ChatSphere will be developed using an iterative, phased approach:

1. Each phase delivers a specific set of features and functionality
2. Phases build upon previous phases incrementally

## Risk Management

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| API Changes (Google AI/Pinecone) | Medium | Medium | Design flexible interfaces in Agent Service; maintain abstraction layers; monitor API updates |
| Performance bottlenecks (Agent Service) | Medium | High | Regular performance testing of Agent endpoints; implement caching; optimize Pinecone queries/indexing |
| Data security concerns | Medium | High | Regular security audits; implement data encryption; secure API keys; restrict Agent Service access |
| Feature scope creep | High | Medium | Maintain clear priorities; use strict change management process |
| Integration challenges (Django <-> Agent) | Medium | Medium | Thorough testing of inter-service communication; robust error handling; clear API contracts |

## Dependencies

- Access to Google Cloud API keys (for Gemini)
- Pinecone account and API access
- Development server resources
- Testing devices (for cross-platform compatibility)

## Flexibility Considerations

This timeline serves as a guideline and may be adjusted based on:
- User feedback during development
- Technical challenges encountered
- Strategic priority shifts
- Resource availability

Progress will be tracked using GitHub Issues and project boards, with regular team reviews to assess timeline adherence.
