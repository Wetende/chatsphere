# Sub-PRD: Security and Compliance Framework

## Overview
This Sub-PRD outlines the comprehensive security and compliance framework for ChatSphere, including authentication, authorization, data protection, and security monitoring following industry best practices.

## User Stories
- **As a user**, I want secure authentication so that my account and data are protected
- **As a user**, I want my personal data encrypted so that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties
- **As a business owner**, I want GDPR compliance so that I can operate legally in Europe
- **As a developer**, I want security scanning so that vulnerabilities are caught early
- **As an administrator**, I want role-based access control so that users have appropriate permissions
- **As a user**, I want secure password recovery so that I can regain access safely
- **As a security engineer**, I want audit logs so that I can track system access and changes
- **As a user**, I want rate limiting protection so that the system is protected from abuse

## Functional Requirements
- Implement **JWT-based authentication** with secure token management
- Create **role-based access control (RBAC)** system for permissions
- Build **data encryption** for sensitive information at rest and in transit
- Establish **security monitoring** and intrusion detection
- Implement **GDPR compliance** features for data protection
- Create **audit logging** for security events and access tracking
- Build **rate limiting** and API protection mechanisms
- Implement **secure password policies** and multi-factor authentication

## Acceptance Criteria
- JWT tokens use secure algorithms with proper expiration and refresh
- User roles and permissions properly restrict access to resources
- All sensitive data encrypted using AES-256 encryption
- Security monitoring detects and alerts on suspicious activities
- GDPR features include data export, deletion, and consent management
- Audit logs capture all authentication and authorization events
- Rate limiting prevents abuse with configurable thresholds
- Password policies enforce strong passwords with optional 2FA
- Security headers implemented (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- Regular security scanning and vulnerability assessments

## Technical Specifications
- **Authentication**: JWT with RS256 signing, secure token storage
- **Authorization**: FastAPI dependencies with role checking
- **Encryption**: cryptography library for AES encryption, bcrypt for passwords
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js equivalent for FastAPI
- **Rate Limiting**: slowapi for FastAPI rate limiting
- **Audit Logging**: Structured logging with security event tracking
- **GDPR**: Data anonymization, export APIs, consent tracking
- **Monitoring**: Security event monitoring and alerting
- **Compliance**: OWASP security practices, regular penetration testing

## AI Coding Prompt
