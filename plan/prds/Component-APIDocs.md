# Sub-PRD: API Documentation and Developer Experience

## Overview
This Sub-PRD outlines the API documentation and developer experience framework for ChatSphere, including comprehensive API docs, SDK development, and developer tools for easy integration.

## User Stories
- **As an API user**, I want comprehensive documentation so that I can integrate with ChatSphere easily
- **As a developer**, I want interactive API documentation so that I can test endpoints directly
- **As a third-party developer**, I want SDKs in multiple languages so that integration is simplified
- **As a developer**, I want code examples so that I can implement features quickly
- **As an API user**, I want webhook documentation so that I can build event-driven integrations
- **As a developer**, I want API versioning so that my integrations remain stable
- **As a developer**, I want rate limiting documentation so that I can handle API constraints
- **As a developer**, I want error handling guides so that I can build robust integrations

## Functional Requirements
- Create **comprehensive API documentation** with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Build **interactive documentation** with try-it-now functionality
- Develop **client SDKs** for popular programming languages
- Create **webhook documentation** with payload examples
- Implement **API versioning** strategy and documentation
- Build **developer portal** with guides and tutorials
- Create **code examples** and integration templates
- Implement **API testing tools** and sandbox environment

## Acceptance Criteria
- OpenAPI specification covers all endpoints with detailed descriptions
- Interactive documentation allows testing with authentication
- SDKs available for Python, JavaScript, and curl examples
- Webhook documentation includes payload schemas and security
- API versioning follows semantic versioning with deprecation notices
- Developer portal includes getting started guides and best practices
- Code examples provided for common integration patterns
- Sandbox environment available for testing without affecting production
- Rate limiting and error responses fully documented
- Authentication and authorization clearly explained

## Technical Specifications
- **API Documentation**: FastAPI automatic OpenAPI generation with custom schemas
- **Interactive Docs**: Swagger UI and ReDoc with authentication support
- **SDK Generation**: OpenAPI Generator for multiple language SDKs
- **Developer Portal**: Static site generator (VitePress/Docusaurus) with API integration
- **Versioning**: URL-based versioning (/v1/, /v2/) with deprecation headers
- **Testing**: Postman collections, curl examples, SDK test suites
- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication with API key management
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format with detailed messages
