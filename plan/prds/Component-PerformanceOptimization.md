# Sub-PRD: Performance Optimization and Scalability

## Overview
This Sub-PRD outlines performance optimization and scalability strategies for ChatSphere, ensuring the platform can handle high traffic loads while maintaining fast response times and efficient resource usage.

## User Stories
- **As a user**, I want fast page loading so that I can access features quickly
- **As a user**, I want real-time responses so that conversations feel natural
- **As a business owner**, I want the platform to scale so that it can handle growing user demand
- **As a developer**, I want efficient database queries so that the system remains responsive
- **As a user**, I want reliable uptime so that I can access my bots anytime
- **As a developer**, I want performance monitoring so that I can identify bottlenecks
- **As a user**, I want efficient memory usage so that the system doesn't slow down over time
- **As an administrator**, I want auto-scaling so that resources adapt to demand

## Functional Requirements
- Implement **response time optimization** for sub-200ms API responses
- Create **database query optimization** with indexing and connection pooling
- Build **caching strategies** for frequently accessed data
- Implement **asynchronous processing** for CPU-intensive tasks
- Create **load balancing** for horizontal scaling
- Build **performance monitoring** with real-time metrics
- Implement **memory optimization** and garbage collection tuning
- Create **auto-scaling policies** for cloud deployment

## Acceptance Criteria
- API endpoints respond within 200ms for 95% of requests
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing and connection pooling
- Redis caching implemented for embeddings and frequent queries
- Background tasks processed asynchronously without blocking requests
- Load balancer distributes traffic across multiple FastAPI instances
- Performance monitoring tracks response times, memory usage, and error rates
- Memory usage remains stable under sustained load
- Auto-scaling triggers based on CPU and memory thresholds
- Frontend bundle size optimized with code splitting
- WebSocket connections handle 1000+ concurrent users

## Technical Specifications
- **API Performance**: FastAPI with async/await, connection pooling, response compression
- **Database Optimization**: PostgreSQL with proper indexes, connection pooling, query optimization
- **Caching**: Redis for session data, query results, and vector embeddings
- **Background Tasks**: Celery with Redis broker for async processing
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx upstream configuration for multiple FastAPI workers
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, custom performance tracking
- **Memory Management**: Python memory profiling, garbage collection tuning
- **Frontend Optimization**: Vite code splitting, lazy loading, bundle analysis
- **CDN**: Static asset delivery via CDN for global performance
