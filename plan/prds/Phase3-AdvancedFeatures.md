# Sub-PRD: Phase 3 - Advanced Features and Integrations

## Overview
This Sub-PRD outlines advanced features for KyroChat, including webhooks, comprehensive analytics, multi-language support, and performance optimizations.

## User Stories
- **As a developer**, I want to integrate webhooks so that my systems can respond to bot events automatically
- **As a business owner**, I want detailed analytics reports so that I can understand my bot's performance and user engagement
- **As an international user**, I want the interface in my language so that I can use the platform comfortably
- **As a user**, I want my bot to remember our conversation context so that I don't need to repeat information
- **As a user**, I want to rate bot responses so that the AI can learn and improve over time
- **As a user**, I want the bot to understand entities in conversations so that it can provide more accurate responses
- **As a user**, I want to export my bot configuration so that I can backup or migrate my settings
- **As a user**, I want to import bot configurations so that I can quickly set up similar bots

## Functional Requirements
- Implement **webhook system** for external integrations
- Create **comprehensive analytics** with detailed reporting
- Add **multi-language support** for international users
- Enhance **conversation context** handling for better responses
