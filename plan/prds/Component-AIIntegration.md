# Sub-PRD: Direct AI Integration System

## Overview
This Sub-PRD outlines the direct AI integration system for ChatSphere, implementing Google Gemini and Pinecone API integration without frameworks, following agentic patterns.

## User Stories
- **As a user**, I want my bot to generate intelligent responses so that it can help visitors effectively
- **As a user**, I want my bot to use my training data so that answers are relevant to my content
- **As a user**, I want fast response times so that conversations feel natural
- **As a user**, I want my bot to maintain context so that conversations flow smoothly
- **As a user**, I want reliable AI performance so that my bot works consistently
- **As a developer**, I want direct API control so that I can optimize performance and costs
- **As a user**, I want my bot to handle different conversation types so that it's versatile

## Functional Requirements
- Implement **direct Google Gemini integration** for text generation
- Create **direct Pinecone integration** for vector storage and retrieval
- Build **embedding generation** with Google AI models
- Develop **context management** for conversation flow
- Establish **agentic behavior patterns** for different bot types
- Create **streaming responses** for real-time chat experience

## Acceptance Criteria
- Direct API calls to Google Gemini without any AI frameworks
- Vector embeddings generated and stored in Pinecone with proper metadata
- Context retrieval finds relevant chunks within 200ms
- Streaming responses provide word-by-word output
- Conversation history maintained for context continuity
- Error handling for API failures with graceful degradation
- Temperature and model parameters configurable per bot
- Cost optimization through efficient API usage

## Technical Specifications
- **AI Models**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp for generation, text-embedding-004 for embeddings
- **Vector Storage**: Direct Pinecone client with namespace organization
- **Streaming**: Async generators for real-time response delivery
- **Context**: Sliding window with vector similarity for relevant retrieval
- **Agent Patterns**: Modular agent behaviors (RAG, conversational, task-specific)
- **Caching**: Redis for frequent queries and embeddings
- **Monitoring**: Request tracking and performance metrics

## AI Coding Prompt
Create agent module with direct API integrations following Claude Code best practices. Implement GeminiClient and PineconeClient classes with proper async patterns. Build context management system with vector similarity. Create streaming response generators. No AI frameworks - pure API calls only. Agent modules in `agent/` directory with clear separation from core app logic. Ensure proper error handling and performance optimization.
