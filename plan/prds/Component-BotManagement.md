# Sub-PRD: Bot Management System

## Overview
This Sub-PRD outlines the bot management system for ChatSphere, providing CRUD operations for chatbots with async FastAPI endpoints and proper user authorization.

## User Stories
- **As a user**, I want to create a new chatbot so that I can customize it for my specific needs
- **As a user**, I want to configure my bot's personality and behavior so that it matches my requirements
- **As a user**, I want to view all my bots in a list so that I can manage them easily
- **As a user**, I want to edit my bot's settings so that I can improve its performance
- **As a user**, I want to delete bots I no longer need so that I can keep my account organized
- **As a user**, I want to see my bot's status so that I know if it's ready to use
- **As a user**, I want to duplicate successful bot configurations so that I can create similar bots quickly

## Functional Requirements
- Implement **bot creation** with name, description, and model configuration
- Create **bot listing** with pagination and filtering
- Build **bot editing** for all configurable parameters
- Develop **bot deletion** with confirmation
- Establish **bot status tracking** (active, training, error)
- Create **bot duplication** functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- Bot creation requires name (required), description (optional), and model type
- Temperature setting between 0.0-2.0 with default 0.7
- System prompt can be customized up to 1000 characters
- Bots are private by default with option to make public
- List endpoint supports pagination with skip/limit parameters
- Only bot owners can view/edit their bots
- Soft delete maintains data integrity
- Status updates reflect training and processing states

## Technical Specifications
- **Models**: Bot model with UUID primary key, owner relationship
- **Schemas**: BotCreate, BotUpdate, BotResponse, BotList with validation
- **Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations with proper HTTP methods
- **Authorization**: User can only access their own bots
- **Database**: Async SQLAlchemy with proper indexes and relationships
- **Validation**: Pydantic models with field constraints and custom validators
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP exceptions with meaningful messages
- **Responses**: Use `response_model` and appropriate `status_code`

## AI Coding Prompt
Generate FastAPI router for bot management with async SQLAlchemy operations. Implement proper user authorization ensuring users can only access their own bots. Use BotService class for business logic separation. Routes in `app/routers/bots_router.py` with endpoints `/api/v1/bots` (GET, POST) and `/api/v1/bots/{bot_id}` (GET, PUT, DELETE). Ensure atomic updates with proper transaction handling.
