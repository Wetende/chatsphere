# Sub-PRD: State Management and API Integration

## Overview
This Sub-PRD outlines the state management architecture and API integration for KyroChat frontend using Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for efficient data management.

## User Stories
- **As a developer**, I want predictable state management so that application state is maintainable
- **As a user**, I want fast data loading so that the interface feels responsive
- **As a developer**, I want automatic caching so that repeated requests are optimized
- **As a user**, I want optimistic updates so that my actions feel immediate
- **As a developer**, I want centralized error handling so that issues are managed consistently
- **As a user**, I want offline support so that I can continue working without internet

## Functional Requirements
- Implement **Redux Toolkit store** with organized slices for different domains
- Create **RTK Query API definitions** for all backend endpoints
- Build **authentication state management** with token handling and refresh
- Develop **optimistic updates** for immediate UI feedback
- Implement **error handling** with user-friendly messages and retry logic
- Create **offline support** with service worker and cache management

## Acceptance Criteria
- Redux store organized with separate slices for auth, bots, analytics, and UI
- RTK Query handles all API calls with automatic caching and deduplication
- Authentication state persists across browser sessions
- Optimistic updates provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Error handling shows appropriate messages and retry options
- Offline functionality caches data and queues actions
- TypeScript types ensure type safety throughout state management
- DevTools integration for debugging and time-travel debugging

## Technical Specifications
- **Store Structure**: Separate slices for user, chatbot, widget, analytics, and UI state
- **API Layer**: RTK Query with custom base query for authentication
- **Middleware**: Custom middleware for authentication and error handling
- **Persistence**: Redux Persist for maintaining state across sessions
- **Offline**: Redux Offline for queue management and synchronization
- **TypeScript**: Proper typing for all actions, reducers, and selectors
- **Testing**: Test utilities for Redux state testing
- **Performance**: Reselect for memoized selectors

## AI Coding Prompt
Set up Redux Toolkit store with RTK Query for API management. Create organized slices for different application domains. Implement authentication middleware with token refresh logic. Build optimistic updates for immediate user feedback. Add error handling with retry logic and user notifications. Set up Redux Persist for state persistence. Ensure full TypeScript integration with proper typing.
