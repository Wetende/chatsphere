- **As a returning user**, I want to log in securely so that I can manage my chatbots
- **As a user**, I want a clean dashboard so that I can quickly see my bot status and activities
- **As a user**, I want consistent navigation so that I can easily move between different sections
- **As a user**, I want responsive design so that I can use the platform on any device
- **As a developer**, I want reusable UI components so that development is efficient and consistent

## Functional Requirements
- Implement **authentication pages** (login, register, password reset)
- Create **main dashboard** with overview widgets
- Build **navigation system** with sidebar and header
- Develop **core UI component library** following design system
- Establish **responsive layout** system for all screen sizes
- Create **routing structure** with React Router v6

## Acceptance Criteria
- Login page with email/password fields and validation
- Registration page with comprehensive form validation
