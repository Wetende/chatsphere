# Sub-PRD: Deployment and DevOps Infrastructure

## Overview
This Sub-PRD outlines the deployment and DevOps infrastructure for KyroChat, including production deployment, monitoring, scaling, and continuous integration without Docker for local development.

## User Stories
- **As a DevOps engineer**, I want automated deployment pipelines so that releases are consistent and reliable
- **As a developer**, I want local development without Docker so that setup is fast and simple
- **As a system administrator**, I want monitoring and alerting so that I can ensure system reliability
- **As a developer**, I want automated testing in CI/CD so that code quality is maintained
- **As a business owner**, I want scalable infrastructure so that the platform can handle growing user demand
- **As a developer**, I want environment parity so that issues are caught before production
- **As a security engineer**, I want secure deployment practices so that the platform is protected

## Functional Requirements
- Create **local development setup** without Docker using virtual environments
- Build **CI/CD pipeline** with automated testing and deployment
- Implement **production deployment** using traditional VPS/cloud hosting
- Set up **monitoring and alerting** for system health and performance
- Create **scaling strategies** for handling increased traffic
- Establish **backup and disaster recovery** procedures
- Implement **security hardening** for production environments

## Acceptance Criteria
- Local development setup works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- CI/CD pipeline runs tests and deploys on successful builds
- Production deployment uses Nginx reverse proxy and systemd services
- Monitoring tracks system metrics, errors, and performance
- Auto-scaling policies handle traffic spikes
- Automated backups run daily with tested restore procedures
- Security scanning integrated into deployment pipeline
- Environment configuration managed securely
- Zero-downtime deployments with rollback capability

## Technical Specifications
- **Local Development**: Python venv, Node.js, PostgreSQL local installation
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI with automated testing
- **Production Hosting**: Ubuntu/CentOS VPS with Nginx, systemd, PostgreSQL
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, structured logging
- **Security**: SSL/TLS certificates, firewall configuration, secrets management
- **Backup**: Automated PostgreSQL backups, file storage backup
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx load balancer for multiple FastAPI instances
- **Process Management**: systemd for service management and auto-restart

## AI Coding Prompt
Create deployment infrastructure focusing on traditional hosting without Docker for local development. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment. Configure Nginx reverse proxy for FastAPI backend. Implement monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. Create systemd service files for production deployment. Set up automated PostgreSQL backups and SSL certificate management. Focus on security hardening and scalability.
